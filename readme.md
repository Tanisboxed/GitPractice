## 📦 Project Overview
TaskHub lets you create, read, update, and delete tasks like a productivity wizard.  
It’s simple, clean, and built with Go — meaning it runs fast enough to make your Java backend cry.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
Before you summon the backend gods, make sure you have:
- Golang ≥ 1.20 (Go old or go home)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas — whichever crashes less for you)
- A .env file with:
```
PORT=4300
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/taskhub
```
