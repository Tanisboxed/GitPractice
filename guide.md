Certainly! Below is a sample **guide.md** file that explains basic Git commands for beginners:

# **Git Commands Guide for Beginners**

Git is a version control system that helps developers manage and track changes in their codebase. This guide will cover the most basic Git commands that every beginner should know to get started with version control.

---

## **1. Initializing a Repository**

### `git init`
To start using Git in a project, you first need to initialize a Git repository. This command creates a `.git` folder to track your project’s version history.

```bash
git init
```

This command is used in the root folder of your project.

---

## **2. Checking the Status**

### `git status`
The `git status` command provides information about the current state of your working directory and staging area. It tells you which files have been modified, added, or deleted, and whether those changes have been staged for the next commit.

```bash
git status
```

- **Changes not staged for commit**: Files you modified but haven't yet added to the staging area.
- **Untracked files**: Files that are new to Git and haven’t been staged or committed.

---

## **3. Staging Changes**

### `git add <file>`
The `git add` command stages changes, which means preparing files for the next commit. You must add files before committing them.

```bash
git add <filename>
```

To stage all changes in the project:

```bash
git add .
```

---

## **4. Committing Changes**

### `git commit -m "<message>"`
Once you’ve staged your changes, you can commit them. Committing saves the changes to the repository's history, along with a message describing the changes made.

```bash
git commit -m "Added a new feature to the app"
```

The commit message should briefly describe what has been changed. Use clear, concise, and meaningful messages.

---

## **5. Viewing Commit History**

### `git log`
To see the commit history for your repository, use `git log`. It shows all previous commits, their IDs, authors, and commit messages.

```bash
git log
```

Use `git log --oneline` for a simpler, condensed view of the commit history.

---

## **6. Branching and Switching Branches**

### `git branch`
Git allows you to work with multiple branches. The `git branch` command lists all branches in the repository. It also shows which branch you are currently on.

```bash
git branch
```

### `git branch <branch-name>`
To create a new branch, use the `git branch` command followed by the branch name:

```bash
git branch feature-xyz
```

### `git checkout <branch-name>`
To switch to another branch, use the `git checkout` command:

```bash
git checkout feature-xyz
```

Alternatively, you can create and switch to a new branch with:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-xyz
```

---

## **7. Merging Branches**

### `git merge <branch-name>`
When you're ready to bring changes from one branch to another, use `git merge`. This command merges the changes from the specified branch into the current branch.

```bash
git merge feature-xyz
```

If there are conflicts, Git will ask you to resolve them manually.

---

## **8. Viewing Changes**

### `git diff`
To see the differences between your working directory and the staging area (uncommitted changes), use:

```bash
git diff
```

This shows what has been modified in the files.

---

## **9. Pushing Changes to a Remote Repository**

### `git push`
Once you've committed your changes, you can push them to a remote repository (like GitHub or GitLab).

```bash
git push origin main
```

This pushes the `main` branch to the remote repository named `origin`.

---

## **10. Pulling Changes from a Remote Repository**

### `git pull`
To retrieve and merge changes from a remote repository into your current branch, use `git pull`.

```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## **11. Cloning a Repository**

### `git clone <repository-url>`
To clone an existing Git repository (e.g., from GitHub), use the `git clone` command with the repository’s URL.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

This creates a local copy of the repository.

---

## **12. Undoing Changes**

### `git checkout -- <file>`
If you want to undo changes in a specific file and revert it to the version in the repository, use:

```bash
git checkout -- readme.md
```

### `git reset <file>`
To unstage a file that has been added to the staging area, use:

```bash
git reset <file>
```

---

## **13. Deleting a Branch**

### `git branch -d <branch-name>`
Once you've finished working on a branch and merged it, you can delete the branch using:

```bash
git branch -d feature-xyz
```

---

## **14. Stashing Changes**

### `git stash`
If you're in the middle of changes but need to switch branches or do something else, you can temporarily store your uncommitted changes with `git stash`.

```bash
git stash
```

Later, you can apply the stashed changes with:

```bash
git stash apply
```

---

## **15. Remote Repositories**

### `git remote -v`
To view the current remote repositories associated with your project, use:

```bash
git remote -v
```

---

## **Conclusion**

These are just some of the basic Git commands you'll encounter when using Git for version control. As you become more comfortable with Git, you'll learn additional commands for advanced workflows, but these basic commands will help you get started with version control and Git repositories.
